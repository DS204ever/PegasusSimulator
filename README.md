**Pegasus Simulator** is a framework built on top of [NVIDIA
Omniverse](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/) and [Isaac
Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). It is designed to provide an easy, yet powerfull way of simulating the dynamics of multirotors vehicles. It provides a simulation interface for PX4 integration as well as custom python control interface.

## Developer Team

This simulation framework is an open-source effort, started by me, Marcelo Jacinto in January/2023. It is a tool that was created with the original purpose of serving my Ph.D. workplan for the next 4 years, which means that you can expect this repository to be mantained by me directly, hopefully until 2027.
